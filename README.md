MultiTenant - Single Database
=============================

**Important:** This is a very experimental plugin written more or less from scratch together with the supporting [Hawk Eventing](http://github.com/multi-tenant/grails-hawk-eventing) and [Hibernate Hijacker](http://github.com/multi-tenant/grails-hibernate-hijacker) plugins. You might be looking for the re-factored version of the original plugin: [Multi Tenant Core](http://github.com/multi-tenant/grails-multi-tenant-core).

Documentation is now hosted at [GitHub Pages](http://multi-tenant.github.com/grails-multi-tenant-single-db/)
