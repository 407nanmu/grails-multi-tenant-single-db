    The Multi Tenant plugin aims to make it easy to set up and develop a multi-tenant application based on Hibernate. 
A multi tenant application will let you run multiple users or customers in the same application instance without them 
being able to see or modify each others data.<p class="paragraph"/>So far this plugin works in "single database" mode. This means that all your tenants will share the same database and tables. 
Hibernate will re-write queries before they hit the database so only data belonging to the  <em class="italic">current</em>  tenant will be fetched.
