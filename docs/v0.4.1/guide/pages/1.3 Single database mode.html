    This plugin is (at least for the time being) focusing solely on single database mode. 
What this means is that every tenant (user, customer..) shares that same database. 
Hibernate will filter all queries targeting multi-tenant domain classes before they hit the database.<p class="paragraph"/>With a multi database approach tenant data will be stored in separate databases. 
This is often a requirement from 'enterprise' customers like banks, governments 
and companies with more lawyers than developers.<p class="paragraph"/><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul class="star">
<li>Tenants can be created and deleted without any maintenance overhead.</li>
<li>You can backup and restore everything in one operation.</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/><h4>Cons</h4>
<ul class="star">
<li>Backup can be more difficult. In a multi database environment you can backup and restore individual tenants. This is obviously a lot more tricky if all tenants share one database.</li>
<li>You might run into database scaling challenges if your tenants produce a lot of data. You might look into key based partitioning.</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>This is by no means a complete list, it's just a couple of points from the top
of my head to give you an idea of what you're buying into, feel free to suggest more pros'n'cons.
