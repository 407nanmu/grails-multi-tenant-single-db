    <h3>Main focus</h3>
<ol>
<li>Focus on single-database mode, while trying to keep the door open for later support for database per tenant as long as it doesn't add too much complexity.</li>
<li>Make sure that the webflow plugin is supported. Without forcing anyone to install it into their projects.</li>
<li>Leverage existing Spring and Hibernate solutions where possible.</li>
<li>Re-think some design decisions and add more support for the most common use cases.</li>
</ol><p class="paragraph"/><h3>Very long term, possibly never (depending on interest and patches)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a separate core plugin independent of Hibernate.</li>
<li>Support multiple-database mode? Hibernate Shards? There are rumors on the street talking about Multi Tenant support in Hibernate 4.</li>
<li>Implement support forÂ name-of-latest-and-greatest-nosql-hype-here</li>
