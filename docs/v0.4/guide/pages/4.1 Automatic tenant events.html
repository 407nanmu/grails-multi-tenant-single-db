    The plugin will trigger a few custom events when changes are made to your tenant domain class. 
This can be very useful for things like maintaining a cache for fast lookups.<p class="paragraph"/>The following events are published when a tenant has been added, updated or deleted: <code>tenant.created</code>, <code>tenant.updated</code> and <code>tenant.deleted</code>.
Have a look at the <a href="http://multi-tenant.github.com/grails-hawk-eventing/" target="blank">documentation for Hawk Eventing</a> for information on how to subscribe to these events.
