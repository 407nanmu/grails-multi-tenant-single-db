The Multi Tenant plugin aims to make it easy to set up and develop a multi-tenant application based on Hibernate. 
A multi tenant application will let you run multiple users or customers in the same application instance without them 
being able to see or modify each others data. 

So far this plugin works in "single database" mode. This means that all your tenants will share the same database and tables. 
Hibernate will re-write queries before they hit the database so only data belonging to the _current_ tenant will be fetched.
