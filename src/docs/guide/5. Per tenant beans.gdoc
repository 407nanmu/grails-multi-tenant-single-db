I recently added _experimental_ support for per-tenant beans. It's implemented using a custom tenant bean scope in combination with a scoped proxy. 

This feature can be configured through config.groovy. See example below-

{code:java}
multiTenant {
    perTenantBeans = [ "someSpringBean" ]
}
{code}
