The plugin ships with _experimental_ support for per-tenant beans. 
It's implemented using a custom tenant scope in combination with a scoped proxy. 

This feature can be configured through config.groovy. See example below:

{code:java}
multiTenant {
    perTenantBeans = [ "someSpringBean" ]
}
{code}

{note}
Spring 2.5 introduced a @Scope annotation, but this seems to be tied to component scanning 
and will not work out of the box with the custom tenant scope introduced by this plugin.
