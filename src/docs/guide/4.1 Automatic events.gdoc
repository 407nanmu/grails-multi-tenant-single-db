The plugin will trigger a few custom events when changes are made to your tenant domain class. 
This can be very useful for things like maintaining a cache for fast lookups. 

The following events are published when a tenant has been added, updated or deleted: @tenant.created@, @tenant.updated@ and @tenant.deleted@.
Have a look at the documentation for Hawk Eventing for information on how to subscribe to these events.
