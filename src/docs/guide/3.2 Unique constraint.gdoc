You must take some extra care with the unique constraint as all tenants will share the same database. 
In the future we might add this automatically during application startup. 

{code:java}
@MultiTenant
class Animal {
    
    String name
    
    static constraints = {
        name unique: 'tenantId'
    }
    
}
{code}
